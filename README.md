# React + TypeScript + Vite + Bootstrap

This is an online-store with a shopping cart. You can add, increment, decrement and delete items in the cart. The project has an advanced file structure and has been implemented with TypeScript, styled with Bootstrap. 
The main feature - is the separate context for the cart, so that it's accessable from any page. There are 2 functions in the Context - custom hook for getting the context itself and a function for implementing the Provider (getting all the values and rendering the cart with add, increment, decrement and delete functions).
